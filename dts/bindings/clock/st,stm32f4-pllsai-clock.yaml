  STM32F4 PLLSAI node binding:

  Takes same input as Main PLL. PLLM factor and PLL source are common with Main PLL

  1 output clocks supported, the frequency can be computed with the following formula:

    f(PLL_R) = f(VCO clock) / (PLLR × PLLDIVR)  --> PLLSAI

      with f(VCO clock) = f(PLL clock input) × (PLLNSAI / PLLM)
